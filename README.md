# Text Classification of COVID-19 Tweets

## Description
This repository focuses on text classification of tweets related to COVID-19 collected from Twitter and Change.org. The goal is to classify the tweets into three categories: lockdown, masking and distancing, and vaccination. A single tweet can have more than one label, meaning it can be associated with multiple categories.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of tweets and texts related to COVID-19. The data was collected from Twitter and Change.org. Four annotators were asked to label each tweet/text into the following categories:
- Lockdown
- Masking and Distancing
- Vaccination

The dataset is provided in a CSV file format and includes the text content of each tweet and the corresponding labels assigned by the annotators.

## Approach
The project involves the following steps:
1. Loading and preprocessing the COVID-19 tweet dataset.
2. Exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution and characteristics of the data.
3. Implementing text classification models using machine learning or deep learning techniques.
4. Model training and evaluation using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Analysis of model performance and comparison of different classification algorithms or architectures.
6. Fine-tuning and optimization of the models for better accuracy and generalization.

## Usage
1) Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/kajolshah310/text_classify_covid_tweets.git
```
2) Open the Part2.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible IDE.

3) Install the required packages and dependencies mentioned in the notebook, if necessary.

4) Execute the code and follow along with the implementation of text classification for COVID-19 tweets.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different algorithms or techniques, or explore additional approaches to improve the classification accuracy.
